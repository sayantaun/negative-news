We now turn to discuss abuse overseas following the conviction of British Music National teacher, James Alexander. Alexander was a former British employed teacher who had worked at Bromsgrove International School in Bangkok. During his time overseas, he tried to orchestrate the abuse of young girls in the Philippines.

Evidence was accumulated against Alexander that he was carrying out offences between 2017-2020. His devices were seized on arrival in the UK which showed he had asked the facilitators to send him images of girls under 13 posing indecent.
