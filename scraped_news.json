Photo: Brookhouse Group Ltd (Image: Brookhouse Group Ltd)\n\nA new Starbucks drive-thru could be opening on a car park on the edge of Oldham town centre.\n\nThe Brookhouse Group has lodged an application with the council to build a branch of the global coffee chain at Alexandra Centre Retail Park.\n\nThe land earmarked for development on Park Road is currently used as a car park.\n\nThe new Starbucks would be located south\u00a0of the Pure Gym and Matalan store which are currently on the site, along with Home Bargains, Shoe Zone, JYSK and Iceland.\n\nAccording the planning documents, the drive-thru building would be single storey and be \u2018significantly smaller\u2019 that the neighbouring units, with landscaping provided around it.\n\nThe development would see a loss of 41 spaces from the corner of the current car park, reducing it to 42 spaces including two disabled bays and cycling stands.\n\nDocuments submitted with the application state: \u201cThe owner of this site has seen an opportunity to add to the Alexandra Retail Park. The existing car park is large enough that a corner can be utilized for a small pod unit.\u201d\n\nThe transport assessment states that it is predicted that the new Starbucks would generate 65 two way car trips during the weekday morning peak, and up to 69 in the Saturday peak.\n\n\u201cThe pod unit is expected to generate a limited number of \u2018new\u2019 trips and would principally act as a complementary facility to the existing retail park,\u201d Hydrock, the transport assessment company states.\n\nStarbucks had previously applied to open a new branch at the Elk Mill Central\u00a0Retail Park on Broadway in Royton.\n\nThere have been no objections or letters of support lodged over the Alexandra Centre application which was lodged this month.\n\nA decision on whether to approve the plans is expected by the end of March.\n\nFood and drink\n\nLeisure\n\nPlanning and development\n\nShare\n\nComments: Our rules\n\nWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
