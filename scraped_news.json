James Comer (R-Kentucky) to Maria Bartiromo on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d show.\n\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s the entire family,\u201d Comer said. \u201cAnd there isn\u2019t a single one of those family members that had the ability to do anything to influence foreign policy other than the big guy, Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nComer said the number of implicated Biden family members will jump from 9 to at least 12, with the president\u2019s son Hunter and brother Frank\u2019s foreign dealings just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nHe said his\u00a0oversight committee is\u00a0still\u00a0reviewing bank records and \u201csuspicious activity reports\u201d that\u00a0indicate members of the first family are benefiting from dealing with foreign entities through limited liability companies that seek\u00a0to shield identities.\n\n\u201cThrough our informants and through our research over the past year and through other investigative reporting, we thought there were around a dozen of these LLCs that were created by Biden family members to disguise or launder where the source of the revenue was coming from,\u201d Comer said.\n\nAP Photo/Alex Brandon\n\n\u201cBut there are many more LLCs. There are many more Biden members \u2026 and many more countries that were involved.\u201d\n\nComer said the\u00a0business dealings involve countries more unsavory than communist China.\n\n\u201cI will say this: China was probably the most reputable country that the Biden family was dealing with,\u201d he said.\n\nThe congressman even suggested that Biden family members may have broken the law by acting as \u201cforeign agents\u201d while not registering as lobbyists to do so.\n\nREUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no rhyme or reason for some of these Biden family members to receive any type of payment from our adversaries around the world, much less the number that we have uncovered. And we\u2019re still digging through these bank violations,\u201d he said.\n\nComer said he\u2019s reviewing six actions that Biden made as president or former\u00a0vice president which he claimed \u201ccould potentially lead back to payments that were made to these LLCs that were then laundered down to the Biden family members.\u201d\n\nsee also\n\nSix more Bidens may have gained from family business schemes: Comer\n\nHe said that ultimately, the probe leads back to Joe Biden because his relatives did not have the power to provide favors to foreign entities or governments.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t found any legitimate business dealings on the Biden end. It looks like, if there wasn\u2019t legitimate business dealing in any of these LLCs, it was influence-peddling. And if you want to get technical, and if you want to get to a legal term, that\u2019s called being a foreign agent. They weren\u2019t registered as a foreign agent,\u201d Comer said of the Biden relatives.\n\nThe congressman also referred to new reports that lawyers for first son Hunter are scheduled to meet with Justice Department officials this week as part of the US Attorney\u2019s Office in Delaware handling the drawn-out investigation into the president\u2019s son.\n\nThe US Attorney\u2019s Office in Delaware is reportedly considering four possible criminal charges that could slap Hunter Biden with two misdemeanor counts of failing to file taxes, a felony count of evading taxes relating to a business expense and lying about his drug use on a gun purchase form.\n\nThe congressman said team\u00a0Biden is in a \u201cpickle here\u201d because \u201cthere\u2019s no rhyme or reason why Hunter Biden shouldn\u2019t have been indicted years ago, even before the last presidential election.\u201d\n\nREUTERS/Kevin Lamarque\n\nHe said House Republicans have been able to crack open up the scandal with their own probe of Biden family business dealings.\n\n\u201cIt would be impossible for the Department of Justice to just cherry-pick Hunter Biden for an indictment and not do anything to [some] other Biden family members, because they were essentially doing the same thing and receiving the same types of payments from our adversaries around the world that Hunter Biden was doing,\u201d Comer said.\n\nsee also\n\nHunter Biden lawyers to meet with DOJ officials next week: reports\n\n\u201cThere are more laws that appear to me that have been broken than just tax evasion. And there are a lot more Bidens involved than just the president\u2019s son and his brother.\u201d\n\nComer said the\u00a0financial dealings involving\u00a0China may be why the president is going soft on the communist adversary.\n\n\u201cNothing on COVID, nothing on Tik Tok, nothing on the spy balloon. China continues to steal our intellectual property. They continue to manipulate our currency,\u201d he said of recent issues involving the communist world power.\n\n\u201cAnd yet this president does nothing about China. It makes you wonder, Maria, whether or not he is in fact compromised because of the millions of dollars his family\u2019s already taken in from the Chinese Communist Party.\u201d\n\nThe White House had no immediate comment.\n\nLast week, Biden ignored a question when asked about the claim that family members benefited from foreign business deals.\n\nShare this article:\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nFlipboard\n\nWhatsApp\n\nEmail\n\nCopy\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled under\n\nhouse oversight committee\n\nhunter biden\n\njoe biden\n\nus house of representatives\n\n4/23/23\n\nRead Next\n\nRussia 'will not forgive' after claiming US barred journal...\n\nTrending Now\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\ton NYPost.com\n\nThis story has been shared 75,562 times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t75,562\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4 college seniors fatally mowed down by out-of-control BMW driver in Malibu\n\nThis story has been shared 69,268 times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t69,268\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLetter from 2,000 actors and musicians slammed for accusing Israel of 'war crimes' while ignoring Hamas terrorist slaughter\n\nThis story has been shared 60,006 times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t60,006\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChilling new image shows Israeli hostage with terrorist captor after cooking for Hamas\n\nwhat to shop now\n\nThese 32 Halloween couples costume ideas are too good to ignore this year\n\nDress up this Halloween as Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce for costumes everyone will be talking about\n\nBest pop culture Halloween costumes of 2023, from 'Barbie' to 'Bridgerton'\n\nReady for an emergency?

He's facing a fellow newcomer who is a familiar face in the Republican party, John James, a businessman and a veteran who has run for the U.S. Senate twice.\n\nThe two will face off in Michigan's newly-drawn 10th District, which covers a large portion of Macomb County and some parts of Oakland County including Rochester and Rochester Hills. I met with both candidates ahead of the election to talk about the issues.\n\nMarlinga is a former Macomb County judge, a prosecutor and a U.S. Assistant Attorney. During his career, he said he set up special units for sexual assault victims, elder abuse, and established a mental health court. He has also done work with The Innocence Project.\n\n\"I've been have been proud of my work as a judge. I've been very proud of my work as a prosecutor and been very proud of my work as a defense attorney. The whole goal being to maximize justice in the system,\" he said.\n\nJames, his opponent, is an army veteran and West Point grad who now serves as president of his family's logistics company. He's a married father of three who lost two races for U.S. Senate in 2018 and 2020.\n\n\"Somebody who understands national security is somebody who can help make our nation safer and somebody who understands supply chain management, especially in this district, which will be the number one manufacturing district in the nation,\" he said.\n\nWhen it comes to the economy and inflation, Marlinga said the U.S. needs to become more energy-independent and believes the key is to produce more clean, renewable energy in the U.S. while adding jobs.\n\n\"Even moving in that direction is going to have an effect on gas prices, because if the OPEC countries know that there is a serious chance that we can divest ourselves entirely from the need for oil and gas, they will not hold us up as they have in the past,\" Marlinga said.\n\nJames scolded the Biden administration for giving an additional $80 million in funding for the IRS, saying he wants to lower taxes.\n\nWe should be allowing more folks to achieve the American dream. And I'm going to be doing everything I can to allow folks to work for themselves, lower taxes, and make sure we can keep our community safer,\" James said.\n\nOther issues they differed on were abortion. James said he's anti-abortion and against Proposal 3, while Marlinga is for abortion rights and supports Proposal 3.\n\nAs for gun control, Marlinga called for red flag laws, raising the age to purchase a gun to 21, and restrictions on high-capacity weapons.\n\n\"There is no reason why weapons of war like that should be in the hands of ordinary people,\" Marlinga said.\n\n\"We absolutely have to keep our promise to keep our community safer, to keep our children safe. But also we have to keep our promise to uphold the Bill of Rights in our Constitution,\" James said.\n\nWhen it came to police funding, both candidates had a similar answer.\n\n\"Well, instead of defunding the police, we have to fund the police. What we have to do is to make sure that our police organizations are fully funded to have their traditional duties, but also to have additional staff to be able to deal with the underlying social causes of crime,\" Marlinga said.\n\n\"We must support our police. We must make sure that communities have the resources they need to stay safe. We must secure our border. We must make sure that we lower crime,\" James said.\n\nWatch their entire interviews below\n\nOne-on-one with Republican John James on Michigan's 10th Congressional District race\n\nOne-on-one with Democrat Carl Marlinga on Michigan's 10th Congressional District race\n\nCopyright 2022 Scripps Media, Inc.

While obtaining identifying information on the vehicle, the Deputy observed drug paraphernalia inside the vehicle. A search of Ms. Vanbrocklin\u2019s coat and wallet produced a vape pen that she admitted was used for smoking THC and a small baggie with over 2 grams of methamphetamine. Vanbrocklin admitted to Deputies she was holding the methamphetamine for a friend.\n\nMs. Vanbrocklin was placed under arrest and transported to the Bonneville County Jail where she was booked for Felony Possession of Methamphetamine.\n\nAt approximately 11pm last night (Dec. 27th), Bonneville County Deputies were dispatched to a report of suspicious activity with people inside a vehicle behind the businesses located in the 2000 S. block of 25th E. in Ammon. Deputies arrived and located the vehicle, identifying 43 year old Carl James Eckenrode as the driver. A female passenger who provided a false name was also in the vehicle and Deputies were later able to confirm her identify as 32 year old Kimberly Ray Hill.\n\nCarl James Eckenrode\n\nMr. Eckenrode was familiar to Deputies as being on Probation and having prior Law Enforcement contacts. At the request of his Probation Officer, Deputies searched Mr. Eckenrode\u2019s vehicle locating items of drug paraphernalia and just over 8 grams of Methamphetamine in the driver seat area. During the search of the vehicle, Deputies found items and an identification card that confirmed Ms. Hill\u2019s identity. A check through dispatch confirmed Ms. Hill had an active Misdemeanor Warrant out of Bonneville County for Failure to Appear at a court hearing.\n\nKimberly Ray Hill\n\nBoth Eckenrode and Hill were placed under arrest and transported to the Bonneville County Jail. Mr. Eckenrode was booked for Felony Possession of Methamphetamine and Misdemeanor Possession of Drug Paraphernalia. Ms. Hill was booked into jail on the outstanding Warrant and Misdemeanor Providing False Information to Law Enforcement.\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nWhatsApp\n\nSMS\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nCopy article link\n\nSave\n\nTags\n\nVehicle\n\nCarl James Eckenrode\n\nCriminal Law\n\nLaw\n\nCrime\n\nBonneville County\n\nMethamphetamine\n\nRiki Jo Vanbrocklin\n\nParaphernalia\n\nKimberly Ray Hill\n\nFeatured Local Savings\n\nRecommended for you\n\nPost a comment as anonymous\n\nEmoticons\n\n[smile]\n\n[beam]\n\n[wink]\n\n[sad]\n\n[cool]\n\n[innocent]\n\n[rolleyes]\n\n[whistling]\n\n[lol]\n\n[huh]\n\n[tongue]\n\n[love]\n\n[sleeping]\n\n[yawn]\n\n[unsure]\n\n[angry]\n\n[blink]\n\n[crying]\n\n[ohmy]\n\n[scared]\n\n[sleep]\n\n[sneaky]\n\n[tongue_smile]\n\n[thumbdown]\n\n[thumbup]\n\n[censored]\n\n[happybirthday]\n\n[ban]\n\n[spam]\n\n[offtopic]\n\n[batman]\n\n[ninja]\n\n[pirate]\n\n[alien]\n\nYour comment has been submitted.\n\nReport\n\nReported\n\nThere was a problem reporting this.\n\nWatch this discussion.\n                    Stop watching this discussion.\n\nGet an email notification whenever someone contributes to the discussion\n\nNotifications from this discussion will be disabled.\n\nStart watching\n\nStop watching\n\n(0) comments\n\nWelcome to the discussion.\n\nLog In\n\nThe Idaho State Journal invites you to take part in the community\nconversation.
